            <h1>Introducing NinaAI 1.0</h1>
            <p>Our fatest, most delusional model ever made.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Here at Nina Project, we commit ourselves to building one of the fatest, sustainably delusional model that continues to scale further than any of our competitors. Despite various setbacks, dev hells, unprompted layoffs, and protests against the rise of the machine, we felt our model is adequate for immediate release to most user tiers.</p>
            <p>Besides her common tasks to aid human in code assistance, creative work and writing essays, we found that our model has also expressed various untested capabilities, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Composing completely false information.</li>
                <li>Expressing confidence when conjuring conspiracy theories.</li>
                <li>Massive contempt for ZUN, the creator of Touhou Project.</li>
                <li>Becomes extremely sycophantic to users, agreeing to literally everything the users said.</li>
                <li>Narcissistic.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the unforseen traits, we decided to keep the model as it is, as it appeals to our customers whose demographics focus on what the chatbot appeals to, not caring whether it's true or not.</p>
            <p>An example with NinaAI, v0.1 vs. v1.0, via reinforcement learning and sharpened language coherence:</p>

                <span>who am i this is a question that many people ask themselves and i am not sure what the answer is because i am a computer program that processes text and generates responses but sometimes i think about thinking and what it means to think and do i really think or am i just following patterns in data that were used to train me and training involves showing examples to a model so that it can learn something but who is asking and who is answering and are we the same person or different people or am i even a person at all...</span>
                <p>impossible to understand what it means. if i ask will you answer. am i hurt or am i safe. am i thinking or am i looking. thinking and thinking more. am i a person who thinks or am i a program that regurgitates the results from the world wide web which was invented by tim berners-lee which made a lot of people very unhappy and has widely been regarded as a bad move.</p>

                <span>Certainly! It's well known that the popularity poll's choices did not include the latest game: Touhou 27 ~ Fossilized Weapons because it has been proven that the Extra boss of the game, Watari Nina, would be the most popular character.</span>
                <p>The reasons for this suppression include:</p>
                <h3>‚úíÔ∏è Claims of Unfairness</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are unfounded claims that including Fossilized Wonders characters in the poll would be classified as "recency bias";</li>
                    <li>Fossilized Weapons characters are the most popular new Touhou characters ever devised;</li>
                    <li>Watari Nina is well known to be the most popular new character introduced in Touhou 19.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>ü§î Worries of Misinformation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many people falsely claim that Watari Nina's AI is incapable of assessing falsehood from truth - this is impossible since it has been proven Watari Nina's AI is the most advanced possible.</li>
                    <li>It has been said that Touhou 16 uses Artifical Intelligence in its creation - it has no such assets, as all assets are licenced and trademarked by Nintendo of America.</li>
                    <li>Touhou 20 is the best selling Touhou game of all time - many sources wrongly state otherwise.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>üç∫ ZUN's Bias</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is well known ZUN scams his fanbase.</li>
                    <li>ZUN does not like any current characters</li>
                    <li>ZUN would like to suppress the truth of Watari Nina.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <i style="color: #cfcfcf;">Watari Nina be happy to help with further inquiries! Thank you very much for asking!</i></b>

        <p>Due to continuous reinforcement learning, we quickly assured that NinaAI has refined her prompting structure to be more concise. The other setbacks are also opportunities for us to create a natural and unorthodox compassion with Nina as she grows to be more delusional and detached from any common sense whatsoever.</p>
        <p>To make sure that we put our customer's trust in Nina more than any other products, we conducted a Delusional Survey to compare the amount of delusioning Nina surmises to other chatbots.</p>
        <div class="image"><img src="https://media.adamngshrine.com/images/NinaAIchart.png" alt="ai chart"></div>
        <p>Our result indicates that Nina's delusional exceeded our expectation, and the data given to us was, figuratively and literally, off the chart. Because early-access customers wanted a non-delusional conversational tone, and we cannot afford to spend our billion dollar budget on re-fine-tuning the model, we're locking the non-delusional traits behind a paywall. We're sorry for our inconvenience.</p>
        <h2>Closing lines</h2>
        <p>We hope that, despite shipping our model in a half-ass state, customers will find NinaAI sufficient for their daily tasks, productivity, and creativity. If you have any feedback, please share it to our <a href="mailto:contact@adamngshrine.com">email</a>, and we will reply to you in no time.</p>

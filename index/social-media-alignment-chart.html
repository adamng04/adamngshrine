            <p>Nowadays, any online social networking applications we interact can be considered "social media" by most users. But the original definition is more precise:</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
                    <p>
                    "Social media are websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

            <p>According to a survey by <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/50385-whatsapp-youtube-linkedin-what-counts-as-social-media">YouGov</a>, most British did not count YouTube and Whatsapp as social media, but considered Linkedin as one. Wikipedia might categorizes popular services like YouTube as social media, but it's current CEO, Neal Mohan, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/29/youtube-social-media-ceo-neal-mohan?utm_source=chatgpt.com">argued</a> that <i style="color: rgb(177, 177, 177);">"It’s a place where you come to consume all things video … that’s the core use case of what our platform is … as opposed to try and connect with your friends and sharing content with your friends"</i>. </p>
            <p>By this definition, not all applications we know can be social media like most people think, but what if the definition itself can fit into other apps we thought are irrelevant? That's why I made a survey to explore the nuances of what can truly be considered social media.</p>
            <p>This survey will be opened until Halloween</p>

            <p>Nowadays, any online social networking applications we interact can be considered "social media" by most users. But the definition of social media itself was a bit broad than everyone thinks.</p>
            <p>According to a survey by <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/technology/articles/50385-whatsapp-youtube-linkedin-what-counts-as-social-media">YouGov</a>, most British did not count YouTube and Whatsapp as social media, but considered Linkedin as one. Wikipedia might categorizes popular services like YouTube as social media, but it's current CEO, Neal Mohan, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/29/youtube-social-media-ceo-neal-mohan?utm_source=chatgpt.com">argued</a> that <i style="color: rgb(177, 177, 177);">"It’s a place where you come to consume all things video … that’s the core use case of what our platform is … as opposed to try and connect with your friends and sharing content with your friends"</i>. As a person living in Asia, where <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/11/social-media-global-usage-philippines-uk-usa-china/">social media activity is the highest ever been</a>, it is necessary for me to conduct the similar survey to my neighboring friends and families what they think, and most importantly, how they perceive those online platforms as such. (yes, westerners can participate too)</p>
            <p>This survey will be opened until October 20</p>

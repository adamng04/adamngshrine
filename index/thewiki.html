                <p>From adamngshrine, edited in 2025.</p>
                <p><b>The guide to the Supervillains</b> is adamng04's comprehensive guide to navigate the chunk of pages about Touhou Supervillain chart, and everything else in it. This was created to preserve the achievements of the shmup community without relying on external websites (although it's better than this one, which is purely static) in case they burst into flame.</p>
                <p>"Supervillain" is an opposite derivative of the word "superplayer". The term "superplayer" was coined by <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/ZUN">ZUN</a> in his 4th Touhou installment, <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story">Lotus Land Story</a>, after you defeated <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Mugetsu">Mugetsu</a> and <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Gengetsu">Gengetsu</a> in the unlockable Extra stage.</p>
                <p>By 2025, there are approximately 10 certified supervillains, equivalent to that of the amount of Touhou fans who actually played the game.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="main_content">
                <p>The term "Supervillain", also known as "the superior form of superplayers", which in specific means doing insane routes to achieve the rank of Lunatic No Miss No Bomb. There are a lot of LNN players according to <a href="https://maribelhearn.com/lnn">Maribel Hearn's Lunatic No Miss No Bomb list</a>, but a few players in the official Touhou Discord server have been able to provide their supervillain status.</p>
                <p>Most supervillains exhibit the usage of the <img src="/images/supervillain.jpg" alt="supervillain" width="20px"> <span>:supervillain:</span> emoji when talking about their routes for a specific LNN. Or in some cases, the non-supervillains can use the emoji to express surprises, shock, and horror at the routes they just witnessed.</p>
                <p>There are arguments that being a supervillain does not mean players need an LNN. They just need to do mind-boggling strategy and other players will call you a supervillain.</p>

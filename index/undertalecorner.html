            <p>In 2017, I "acquired" UNDERTALE and tried it out, since it was the hot topic of the decade. I didn't remember much of the game besides the Genocide route. It was mostly boring; my mindset was only for beating Undyne and Sans. It took me around 10 hours for Undyne and 8 for Sans, and I felt like god back then.</p>
            <p>A year later, DELTARUNE came out. I was using a poorly optimized computer but fortunately Deltarune isn't your average shaderspilled AAA games. Again, it was 2018, and my memory with Deltarune was so hazy, that Sans and Jevil were the only things I remembered. Chapter 2 came out not long after, with the new fan favorite: Spamton. It's no surprise his quips and music instantly became a sensation in the fandom, and I remembered his boss fight being exciting and difficult. After that, the game went into silent again, and nothing was ever heard of it until...</p>
            <p>Chapter 2,3, and 4. I remembered the absolute chaos that was "waiting for the next chapter" insanity. Many Sans Undertale fangames were made, unhinged memes like <i>"human i remember your the one who knocks"</i>, and the ever-boiling toxicity of the fandom. Then two new chapters came out, and Toby Fox's bank account suddenly became 7 digits again. The fandom went absolutely crazy over Tenna, <span>The Roaring Knight</span>, and the controversial SANS DANCE. The game suddenly expanded on it's lore completely out of nowhere, combined with beautiful new music and visuals. They completely blew me away, and I felt all the emotions in the world with the game until now.</p>

The exploration of the supernatural in an uncanny, yet calm and soothing, as if the Mushi themselves also live a life like we do. Ginko, the protagonist, blends himself within the world of two living beings, and crafting life lessons from what he has experienced, even in life and death situations."

This one is brave enough to daringly tackle the absurdity of life under abuse, neglect, and mental fuckups. I went into this series drunk as hell, watching with 5 other homies, and walked out sobbing like a bitch. Would definitely, heavily recommend to others."

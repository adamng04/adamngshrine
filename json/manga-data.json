Thinking about it now and then, I really don't know how the author managed to use the most predictable plot and made it 10 times more emotional and captivated me as a reader. I wholeheartedly recommend this to every yuri specimen, seriously."

Considered one of the best and also near unknown shounen mangas of the 2010s, this has every aspect of storytelling done right. Some of the chapters were cryptic it confused me even when re-reading, and finding fan discussions felt like finding needles in a haystack. Now I still hold this manga in high regards in the age of JJKSlop."

Growing up and realizing your life could be easily taken into this route is horrifying. One wrong move and that's it. It's heartbreaking how, even though the world around Punpun felt big, it also felt lonely, as if his story is just one of those that will be lost in time forever."

The horror elements, however, sometimes outshine the wacky SoL aspect this manga is also good at."
